    Parameters

    mission_id : str, optional

    """Write a self-contained HTML report for *ds* under *outdir* and return the landing page path.

    With *layout* ``"root"`` (the default) *outdir* is treated as a **root**: the report is written
    into ``<outdir>/<mission_id>/`` (created if absent), so a root can hold many missions side by
    side. With *layout* ``"flat"`` the pages are written directly into *outdir* and no navigator is
    built (*navigator* is ignored) — one mission, one self-contained folder.

    The ``mission_id`` subdirectory name is the OG1 ``id`` attribute when present, else the source
    file stem (see :func:`glidertest.reports._mission.mission_id`); pass *mission_id* to override it
    (run through the same directory-name sanitising). Each applicable page in
    :data:`glidertest.reports._mission.PAGES` is written to ``<page>.html``; the pages share one
    ``figures/`` with page-prefixed slugs (``<page>_<panel>.png``) and a cross-page nav. A
    machine-readable ``report.json`` manifest is written beside the landing page.

    With *navigator* ``True`` (the default, root layout only), ``<outdir>/index.html`` — a fleet
    navigator over every ``<outdir>/*/report.json`` — is rebuilt after the mission is written (see
    :func:`navigator`). The rebuild redraws the fleet track map, so for a **batch** pass
    ``navigator=False`` in the loop and call :func:`navigator` once at the end rather than rebuilding
    on every mission.

    Figures are rendered under the non-interactive ``Agg`` backend for the duration of the build,
    then the caller's backend is restored. glidertest's plotters call ``plt.show()`` when they draw
    their own figure, which would pop a window per panel on an interactive backend (e.g. ``macosx``);
    ``Agg`` makes that a no-op. Switching the backend closes any figures the caller had open.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xarray.Dataset
        An OG1 glider dataset.
    outdir : pathlib.Path or str
        The root directory (``layout="root"``) or the mission's own directory (``layout="flat"``).
    navigator : bool, default True
        Rebuild ``<outdir>/index.html`` (the fleet navigator) after writing the mission. Ignored
        when ``layout="flat"``.
    mission_id : str, optional
        Subdirectory name for this mission, overriding the name derived from *ds*; run through the
        same sanitising as the derived name. Must not be combined with ``layout="flat"`` (there is
        no subdirectory to name) — doing so raises :class:`ValueError`.
    layout : {"root", "flat"}, default "root"
        ``"root"`` writes the mission into ``<outdir>/<mission_id>/``; ``"flat"`` writes the pages
        directly into *outdir* and builds no navigator.

    Returns
    -------
    pathlib.Path
        The path to the written landing page (``<outdir>/<mission_id>/index.html`` for root layout,
        ``<outdir>/index.html`` for flat).
