"""Shared report design tokens — the single source of every presentation value.

This module is written to be **vendored** across the packages that share the
report design system.  It is
package-neutral — it names no package and holds only data (plus the mplstyle
path, resolved relative to this file so no package name appears in the text) — so
the copies can be frozen and checked later; for now this document and convention
are the shared reference (no cross-repo hash test yet).  A value that belongs to
one package (a scientific variable registry) does **not** live here.

Layering: this is a leaf, and it lives in ``config/`` for that reason — its only
import is :mod:`pathlib`.  Both the plotters (which size figures from
:data:`SLOTS`) and the report/CSS layer read it; it reads nothing of theirs.
Placing it under ``reports/`` would form an import cycle
(``plotters.plots -> reports -> reports._index -> plotters.plots``).

Part II of ``2026-08-12-report-spec.md`` is the prose behind these numbers.
Templates and plotters read them; they never restate them.
